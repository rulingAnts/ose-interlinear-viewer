OneStory Editor Interlinear Viewer

Imports stories from OneStory Editor data file and displays or exports them as Interlinear Texts as XLingPaper documents, HTML web pages, or (coming soon) Word/OpenOffice XML documents.


Here's how to use this app:

1. Download the portable version (/dist/ose-interlinear-exporter<version>.exe) or use the MSI installer 

2. Double-click the portable version you downloaded (ose-interlinear-exporter<version>) or use the start menu or desktop shortcut to launch the program you just installed (if you used the installer).

3. Click "XLingPaper" or "Web Page" depending on what format you want to use. If you use "Web Page", there are fewer things you can do with it, but you can view the interlinearized back translation right away without needing to install and learn XLingPaper.

4. Click "Choose..." and find your OneStory Editor database. It is usually located in the Documents (or My Documents) folder in a folder called "OneStory Editor Projects" or "My OneStory Editor Projects". Within that you should find a file named "<projectname>.onestory" (where <projectname> is the name of your OneStory Project on languageForge/LanguageDepot).

5. When you click "open", a list of stories to choose from should appear. You can filter for biblical, non-biblical, or all, and they'll appear in the dropdown list for you to choose from. Choose the one you want and click "Generate...". If you chose "XLingPaper" then it'll prompt you to save an XML file that you can open in XLingPaper. If you chose "Web Page", then a new window will open showing the story in a much more readable interlinear view.

Note: The app now lets you display the free translation either in block paragraph form at the end (like Paratext), inline with the word-for-word back translation (like FLEx), or both. The paragraph view at the end is great for paying attention to the overall discourse flow of a story and looking for big-picture plot-structure and information-flow issues like we talked about in the Language Team Training workshop.
